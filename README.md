I need a trading companion and someone that knows what the hell they're doing on 
her, I've accumulated a lot of stocks and coins but I don't even have the software to 
receive it at the moment on the purchases I've already made, that art separated 
throughout different areas in my life one Being Coinbase where I keep a lot of my 
supplies and I would like someone to help me learn how to do all of this as well and  
share the profits with me that I've already accumulated And of course make more.
